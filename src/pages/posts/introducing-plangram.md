[Matt](https://twitter.com/mrtnmatt), [Anthony](https://twitter.com/anthness) and I launched [Plangram](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/plangram-share-make-plans/id976660311?ls=1&mt=8). It is available today, for free on the Apple App Store.

Plangram is a quick, easy, and fun way to make casual plans with your friends with Instagram. Create custom photo based plan cards and share them with your friends via Instagram Direct.

Matt & I have always toyed with the idea of creating an app that focuses on easy event planning. A few years ago we started a service which allowed users to share a short unique url that gave users the ability to mark their attendance in a single click.

After many iterations of the project we decided it was time to call it a day and focus our energy into building something which was easier to use and didn’t require user authentication.

We wanted to build a utility that served a simple purpose but illustrated the beautiful mechanics of iOS design. We believe we did it.
