# Now

Over the last few years I've been working closely with a lot of companies embracing headless commerce, headless APIs, and the Jamstack.

I'm Head of Developer Relations at [GraphCMS](https://graphcms.com). I spend most of my days writing documentation, working as a marketing engineer, speaking with developers, and collaborating on projects with the community.

When I'm not working, you'll find me downtown Verdansk.
