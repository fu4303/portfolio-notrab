# Hire

I've worked across the stack, from building a monolithic applications with Rails, to a fully serverless dropshipping online store.

Whether you're looking to outsource some work, or want to discuss how you should build your next project, we should talk.

If you need someone who has experienced in the following areas, we _really_ should talk.

- Serverless
- Jamstack
- Headless APIs
- JavaScript
- React, Next.js, Gatsby, and Gatsby plugins
- Ruby on Rails
- Content Modelling
- Video tutorials
- documentation
- SDKs
