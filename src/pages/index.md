# Hello

I'm Jamie, a software engineer, born and bred in North East England.

I've been building websites, and applications since 1999, and been around long enough to remember the days I built preloaders for Flash websites.

Thankfully those days are gone, and you'll [now](/now) find me working with headless APIs, JavaScript, React, GraphQL, and most recently learning how to program in Go.

If you're interested in any of the above, or what I'm up to, take a look at some of my recent posts below.
